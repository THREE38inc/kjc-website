<p style="text-align:justify;"> A few years ago, there was an attempt to encapsulate and treasure down in the burrows of the earth, all the available accrued knowledge of this globe, for future generations to explore and discover. Future generations may or may not be interested in such a time capsule from the past.
</p>
<br/>

<p style="text-align:justify;" > At Kristu Jayanti College, the academic fraternity is an active community of learners who pursue knowledge as an active and dynamic phenomenon with infinite and immense possibilities. We invest in the younger generations to instill in them the passion for knowledge and the seeds of research and learning. We strive to build a community of learners and teachers who believe that learning is not possible without teaching and teaching is not at all possible without learning.

<p style="text-align:justify;" > The academic fraternity of Kristu Jayanti College strives to inherit the passion and vision of the 19th century visionary, Blessed Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara reaching to us through the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI)Congregation of Priests who provide the leadership for this noble institution named after the supreme guru, Jesus Christ, whose birth is commemorated in the name of Kristu Jayanti. Jesus said: Truth will liberate you. (John 8:32). Pursuit of knowledge is the pursuit of truth that should lead us to the motto and vision of this institution: "Light and Prosperity".
