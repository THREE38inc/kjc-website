	<p align=justify>Gramasamveditha is the social outreach programme organized every year and a CSR initiative. The students undertake rural development activities in a chosen village. It is seen that management students, who in turn are going to be future managers and policy makers, do not have a rural perspective and hardly understand the needs and wants of India in her villages. According to the 2011 census of India, 68.84% of Indians (around 833.1 million people) live in 640,867 different villages. This brings to focus the requirement of management students to understand and to have hands on experience of rural life in India, if they are to address the needs of the majority of Indians.</p>

	<p align=justify>The management department of Kristu Jayanti College organizes 'Gramasamveditha' every year for its first year MBA and PGDM students keeping in mind the need to provide rural exposure and perspective to the budding managers from KJC.</p>
