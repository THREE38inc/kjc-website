The development of this skill will be demonstrated by participation in the event.</p>

Students submitting an abstract but not intending to give a paper can be offered feedback on their abstract for further skills development.</p>

Students giving papers will have to respond to questions appropriately and work with the chair of the session. Peer review will be used to ensure that speakers gain the maximum benefit from their participation: it will provide all speakers who agree to be reviewed with anonymous comments and assessment of their presentation (generally and in terms of specific features such as use of visual aids) from members of the audience. In addition, this will develop the skill of active listening among audience members, and may help to stimulate more reflective questions. Chairs of sessions will develop skills including offering questions and introducing speakers.</p>

In particular, by incorporating the theme of knowledge transfer and research accessibility, speakers will be asked to address the theme of the outreach of research explicitly. The development of this skill will be demonstrated by participation in the event.</p>

All postgraduates in the Department will be invited to submit a 200 word Abstract (in advance of Colloquium to the Colloquium Committee). Students submitting an abstract but not intending to give a paper can be offered feedback on their abstract for further skills development.</p>

Students giving papers will have to respond to questions appropriately and work with the chair of the session. Peer review will be used to ensure that speakers gain the maximum benefit from their participation: it will provide all speakers who agree to be reviewed with anonymous comments and assessment of their presentation (generally and in terms of specific features such as use of visual aids) from members of the audience. In addition, this will develop the skill of active listening among audience members, and may help to stimulate more reflective questions. Chairs of sessions will develop skills including offering questions and introducing speakers.</p>
