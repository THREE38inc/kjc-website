		Kesaregere village, Kolar, Karnataka 14th to 16th August, 2014</p>
	
	
	<p align=justify>The village exposure program for the MBA and the PGDM batch was held from 14th August to 16th August. The program was exciting and entertaining. We students got to learn so many things from this trip. It was a first time trip to a village for many students and all of them were ready to meet the challenges they would have to face. Even the people in the village were very cooperative, anytime you wanted a help they were always there by your side. Though many of the students did not know the language but still they made sure that they were interacting and having fun with all the students present there. The village atmosphere and serenity was also very pleasant and the greenery around was very appealing to the eyes. Though the climate was both hot and cold we had a great time together.</p>

	<p align=justify><b>DAY 1:</b><br>
		We started from the college at 2 pm on 14th August and reached Kesaragere village around 4pm. We were happily greeted by all the people who were present there and we were indeed very glad to see them too. After an hours rest all the 10 groups were sent to 3 various villages for survey. The questionnaire contained 25 questions and each family in the village had given almost the same answers to the questions asked. Every group had to complete 22 houses and take the survey. Not all the people there are educated and most of them are farmers. When the students enquired about their yearly income not many of them had more than 10000 and the rest were just 5000 and below. Most of the children were educated including girls. Self-help groups do not provide much help to the villagers and so many people do not want to become a part of any group because they feel that those groups would do no good to them. But there are few women who have a membership in some groups like shrishakthi, sthree sangha etc. The sanitary facilities in most of the houses is very poor. The government does not take any initiative in developing the village but they still hope that some day they will offer help. All the students had a very good time during the survey because we could interact with all the people and get to know what they are going through.</p>

	<p align=justify><b>Day 2:</b><br>
		15th August the 68th Independence Day was celebrated in high spirits with all the village students. They hoisted the flag and the national anthem was sung by the students. Then the village students and the Jayantians performed few programs and sang patriotic songs. Then there were few sports events held for the primary and high school students. And the rest of the afternoon all students were busy with practicing for the cultural program. The cultural program started at 7:30pm and all the groups performed different programs. All the students and their parents and few other villagers were present for the cultural program. They were really a great source of encouragement for us students and we really are very grateful to them. Finally we had a campfire in the night.</p>

	<p align=justify><b>Day:</b><br>
		We conducted few awareness programs and literary program for both the primary and high school students. The prizes were finally distributed to all the winners of the various events. Finally it was a very pleasant trip with more real lifec exposure. We thank the department and faculties for organising this program for us. This trip made a very big impact in our life.</p>
