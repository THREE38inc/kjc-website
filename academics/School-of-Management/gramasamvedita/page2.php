	<p align=justify>The camp provided many lessons for the aspiring managers, which classrooms would not have given them. Quoting Jim Rohn - " Formal Education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune," . while reminiscing their experiences , Divya Mathew told that -- Personally this rural exposure camp was a eye opener. It changed the kind of perspective i had about the village life. I learnt a lot by going to the village. From a managerial and academics point of view I learnt primarily that language is no barrier to get things done. Communication is the key role. I learnt not become judgemental and prejudiced and Praveen George told that -- I also noticed that in one instance when i approached a big house for spoons for a sports event, we did not get. But then when we went to a smaller house we got them immediately. I also learnt to some extent the art of time management which is so very essential in today's fast moving professional and personal life. The camp also taught me to deal with Stress Management. It also enhanced my leadership skills.</p>
