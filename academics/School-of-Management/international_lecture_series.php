								<li>Managing externalities</li>

TIME: 3.30pm.<br>
									The second International Lecture Series for the MBA & PGDM batch was held on 30th July 2014 at 3.30pm. The session started off with an invocation song by the department choir, followed by the welcome speech and a brief introduction about the speaker for the day. The speaker for the ILS was Mrs. Anupama Menon (Director, Research Axis Ltd, UK). She has a very advanced knowledge of market research and has setup her very own company Research Axis in UK. She completed her B.E from Bangalore and later pursued her MBA from USA. At present she is working in UK. She has also been working with Edkons International Education Consultancy, which offers opportunities for students from Middle East and India.</p>

								<p align=justify>Ms. Anupama started the session by sharing her own experience, how she worked towards achieving her goal, every point was explained by her experience in life. Every step of the way has a bump and learning and experience during the day will help us to move forward. As students we need to put ourself in the real world and see what can be learnt from the world outside. There are so many things that one needs to learn along the journey of life. The foremost potential that an individual must acquire is 'communication skills'. Even if we have all other skills but lack communication skills, we can never come up. We must be able to put forward all our ideas and views by communicating to others. This was explained by an infamous example, 'the elevator pitch'. One must be able to explain or give brief information about yourself to another person or an interviewer within 30 seconds because research says; a human attention span is less than that of a gold fish.</p>

								<p align=justify>Great academics can get you through the door, you need much more to survive and flourish and hence we need to be proactive, take genuine interest in the entire process, be enterprising, have entrepreneurial thinking, decision making skills and learn to work with a team and lead it effectively. The next crucial thought that a determined person needs is passion, this is explained well with a famous quote by Steve Jobs, "If you don't love what you do, well you should not be doing it". "There is an expiry date for excuses" J.K.Rowling. We cannot always give excuses and move away without doing things, but we must take up responsibilities and tasks and work towards the accomplishment of that. If the task is important to you, you'll find a way, if not you'll find an excuse.</p>

								<p align=justify>Ms. Anupama concluded the session by stating a quote given by Jhump Lahiri, Your still young, free. Do yourself a favour, before its too late, without thinking too much about it first, pack a pillow and a blanket and see as much of the world as you can. You will not regret it. The session was very interactive and mesmerizing, it concluded by the vote of thanks.</p>

								<p align=justify>The third international lecture series session for the MBA & PGDM batch was held on 12th August 2014. The session started off with an invocation song by the department choir, followed by the welcome speech and a brief introduction about the speaker for the day. The speaker for the day was Dr. Marina Apaydin, professor, department of management, the American University in Cairo. She is a professor in strategic management; she did her MBA in finance and international business and MA in Islamic studies. She has worked and consulted in different countries like USA, France, Saudi Arabia etc. Dr .Marina has written many articles and has also been serving as a board of director.</p>

								<p align=justify>Dr Marina started the session by showing a small video on how to be determined and daring and move ahead in life. She emphasized on few other topics i.e. why don't we get what we want, 3A approach to life, building your career, building your portfolio and networking. The reason behind why we don't get few things in our life is because we don't know what we want in life. Firstly we need to realize what we want, plan how you want to get it, make a strategy to fulfill the plan. 3A approach Awareness, Analysis and Action "the general population doesn't know what is happening and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know". There are certain things in our life that we know but there are also things that you don't realize that you know. We as humans need to analyze certain things and we should never come to a conclusion that we know everything. An idea not coupled with an action never becomes bigger than the brain cell it occupies. We need to understand the strategic triangle i.e. what you want, what you can do and what the market needs. Make your own luck "There is no elevator to success; you have to take the stairs", hence we need to increase the number of skills and increase the depth of our skills. Dr Marina also emphasized on how we can build our portfolio.</p>

								<li>A well designed continuously updated CV.</li>
								<li>Learn new languages and improve your accent</li>
								<li>Improve your communication skills</li>
								<li>Practice behavioral techniques and body language</li>
								<li>Learn new application</li>
								<li>Research information extensively</li>
								<li>Never be afraid to volunteer for unknown new tasks</li>
								<li>Practice makes perfect</li>

								<p align=justify>She concluded the session by discussing the top reasons to get a business degree. Hear something, improve your career and establish a network. It's not all about you; it's what you can do for others. The session was very interesting and interactive. The ILS concluded with the college anthem</p>

								<p align=justify>He initiated his lecture session with overview of how Globalization changed the way of business which makes the producers hard to survive in the current market due to the high competition unless they are able to create a name and brand. He advised the students to be competitive and in a country like India where competition is intensified we need to show that we are more bright and better than other prospects. We should know what to do and what not to do. Time is the most important and utilizing time in the best way is the key to success. Ninety percent is hard work and ten percent is luck for success. He also stressed on the importance of interdependence.</p>

								<p align=justify>In addition he discussed the Indian IT sector which derived a lot of revenue from U.S sector and how important a role Indians play in US. He was able to introduce the Masstige marketing strategy which is a combination of mass market and prestige brands. It generally tries to create a top awareness of a company brand among large population. He was able to also introduce S to S(sales to stranger) marketing with triple S strategy.</p>

								<p align=justify>It was learning and interactive session for the students where he answered all the queries put up by the students to their full satisfaction.
