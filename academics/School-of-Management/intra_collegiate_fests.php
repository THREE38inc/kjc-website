								<p align=justify>The Department of Management Studies, organizes the annual theatre competition for the first year Management students called Abhigyan. Abhigyan means "Supreme Knowledge". Abhigyan is a unique theatre fest, where students portray management concepts of their choice through theatre.</p>

								<p align=justify>This edition of Abhigyan involved students of the 2014-16 batch. The first meeting was held on 18-Dec-14 where students were given a brief overview of ABHIGYAN 2015. Soon after the winter break, the work had started.</p>

								<p align=justify>106 students from MBA/PGDM were divided into 9 teams with an average of 11 members in each team. The department assigned two mentors from the 2nd years to each team to assist and guide the students.</p>

								<p><b>The team names were allotted randomly on the basis of Old English plays primarily by Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</b><br>
	<b>The team names are:</b>
	<li>Macbeth</li>
	<li> Hamlet</li>
	<li>Julius Caesar</li>
	<li> The Merchant of Venice</li>
	<li> Sherlock Holmes</li>
	<li>Tempest</li>
	<li>Othello</li>
	<li> Pygmalion- GBS</li>
	<li> Robin Hood</li>
<p align=justify>The teams were asked to come up with a management concept from any stream of Marketing, Finance and HR. Deadlines for submission were also intimated to the teams.</p>
<p align=justify>Every team had to make a teaser, poster and trailer for their respective plays. The teaser duration was a minimum of 30 seconds and trailers not exceeding more than a minute. The teams also made posters of their plays which was very creative and kept us guessing till the end. Abhigyan is the platform where not only the 1st years learn but also helps the 2nd years to understand, organize and do things systematically.</p>
	<p>This edition of Abhigyan has indeed made a great impact on us, strengthening our base in management.</p>
