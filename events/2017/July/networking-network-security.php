            <p align=justify>Dr. Samir, the Development Director of Kristu Jayanti College, conducted a two day workshop on Networking & Network Security. The session was kick-started by a discussion on the various security implications and vulnerabilities followed by a foundation course in Socket programming and Raw Socket programming. Several open problems were put up to the audience which could be utilized as research motivation. Career Guidance was an integral part of simultaneous lectures. Various trending practices were introduced along with XSS, SQL injections, authentication checks, parameter checking, session hijacking, and CRLF/CSLF. Dr. Samir clearly demonstrated lab sessions for network experiments in Wire-shark and NMAP. Thus, giving a touch of realism to the knowledge gained. </p>
