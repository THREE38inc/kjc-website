            <p><b>Classes Attended & Number of beneficiaries:</b> III SEM BCA, III SEM B.Sc., V SEM BCA, V SEM B.Sc. - 600 students</p>

            <p><b>Name and details of the Resource Person:</b>  Mr. Sawrav Roy, Senior Software Development Engineer, Amazon Fulfilment Technologies</p>

            <p><b>Objective:</b>  To impart knowledge on the basics of Machine learning- its types, its difference from a standard rule based learning approach, existing job profiles in this domain.</p>


            <p align=justify>The session started with the speaker prompting for a difference between rule based learning and adaptable learning. He quoted the difference between how a machine works when it is made to do a routine task having pre-defined set of rules and when it has find an adaptable solution. He further explored the adaptable learning aspect by quoting the example of “steps involved in distinguishing between an apple and orange (for a machine)”. The speaker emphasized that we go for machine learning when the human expertise for a task doesn’t exist or when humans are unable to explain their expertise or when the solution has to be adapted with changes in the environment. He also explained the various forms of machine learning-association analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning to name a few. Thereafter a video was played which showed the working of a simple perceptron model, multilayer perceptron, spiking perceptron and convolutional perceptron. He also emphasized that the aim of a learning algorithm is always to minimize the error loss with every passed data set and mentioned two core learning algorithms WCore and BP(Back Propagation). The speaker then mentioned about Tensor Flow which is an open source library available for ML, which can be used to create simple to complex ML algorithms. He also mentioned that students can use Scikit-Learn that leverages Python’s breadth for math and science related ML problems. Finally he concluded the session with the job opportunities available to students in this area. Two promising job profiles – one of a developer role (entry level) and second of a ML Scientist role were well appreciated by the speaker.</p>
