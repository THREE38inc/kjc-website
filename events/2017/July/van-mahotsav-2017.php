            <p align=justify>Centre for Social Activities of Kristu Jayanti College had organised <b>“Van-Mohotsava”</b> on 8th July 2017 at Nagenahalli Lake Belt. Around 160 CSA volunteers, Staff coordinators planted 60 saplings around the lake. <b>Rev. Fr. Emmanuel P. J.</b> appreciated students for taking up a noble initiative. The event created an enthusiasm among students towards preservation of forest and planting of trees, as “trees mean water, water means bread and bread is life”. This program would gift a green environment to the coming future.</p>
