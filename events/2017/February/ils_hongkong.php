			<p align=justify>Social withdrawal currently is a prominent issue faced by migrants especially by the youth and due to the unfavourable social situations to promote their upward movement has resulted in Social Withdrawal among the migrated community. With this perspective in mind, as part of International Lecture Series, the Department of Social Work, Kristu Jayanti College on the 16th February 2017, organised a Lecture on Understanding Social Withdrawal of Young People in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p align=justify>The esteemed resource person for the expert lecture was Fr. Dolphie Sequirra (Director, Don Bosco South Asian Youth Services, Hong Kong) who was welcomed with a bouquet of flowers by Dr. Jonas Richard A. (Head, Department of Social Work, Kristu, Jayanti College).</p>

			<p align=justify>The expert speaker commenced the session by giving an overview on the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong namely Filipinos, Srilankans, Indians, Whites, Indonesians, Pakistanis, Japanese, Nepalese and Malaysians. Fr. Sequirra stated that out of these minorities the South Asian community were the vulnerable population. The critical aspects on the social issues such as discrimination, racism, economic deprivation, social degradation, unemployment, cultural differences, inequality in treatment, stereotyping faced by these ethnic minorities and their causes were discussed during the session. Sociological concepts such as Rationalization and McDonaldization which are the recent change agents in culture was highlighted by the speaker.</p>
