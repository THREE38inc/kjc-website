			<p align=justify>Nature was respected for all its valuable resources by our ancestors. But when man's greed took over, we took more from nature and gave back very little. This imbalance led to enormous destruction. In the past two decades, environment has attracted the attention of decision makers, scientists and even laymen in many parts of the world. They are becoming increasingly conscious of issues such as famines, droughts, floods, scarcity of fuel, firewood and fodder, pollution of air and water, problems of hazardous chemicals and radiation, depletion of natural resources, extinction of wildlife and dangers to flora and fauna. People are now aware of the need to protect the natural resources -air, water, soil and plant life that constitute the natural capital on which man depends.</p>

			<p align=justify>Unless environmental issues are solved or taken care of, the future generations may find earth not worth living. The need of the planet and the needs of the person have become one. There is no denying the fact that environment has to be protected and conserved so as to make our future life possible. Indeed, man's needs are increasing and accordingly the environment is also being altered and nature is accommodating the pressure and is regenerative to some extent. Yet there is a limit to nature's capacity, especially when the pressure of exploding population and technology keep mounting. It is time that we unite to work towards the conservation and improvement of the changing and fragile environment.</p>

			<p align=justify>The government has taken various measures to improve the quality of our environment. Some of the major steps were Wild Life (Protection) Act, with the objective of effectively protecting the wild life of this country and to control poaching, smuggling and illegal trade in wildlife and its derivatives. The Ganga Action Plan (GAP) Phase - I which was taken up as 100% centrally funded scheme and aimed at preventing the pollution of river Ganga and to improve its water quality. Odd-even rule under which vehicles are allowed to run across the city based on their registration numbers, banning of the manufacture and use of plastics below 50 microns are some of the measures implemented by the government towards this goal. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has established a network of monitoring locations on aquatic resources across the country. The monitoring of water quality initiated during 1977-78 under Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) and gradually increased the network to cover all the aquatic resources. Article 51 A of the Indian Constitution states that "it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environmental including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures."</p>

<p align=justify>The Environment Club of Kristu Jayanti College aims to create awareness on various environmental issues prevalent today. The objective of conducting the environment awareness day in our college is to:<br>
• Promote environmental education at all level and create public awareness<br>
• Promote environmental safety-technologies, recycling of resources and utilization of wastes<br>
	• Conserve and develop safe, healthy, productive, and aesthetically satisfying environment</p>

			<p align=justify>The Environment Club of Kristu Jayanti College organized an Environment Awareness program on 23rd February, 2017. The theme, 'Let's Nurture the Nature for a Better Future’ was portrayed in the form of dance and skits by the students of Life Sciences Department. The Environment Club of Kristu Jayanti College also organized a poster making competition on the topic 'Global Environment Tomorrow' which was open for the students of all the Departments of the college. The posters were displayed and the exhibition was open to all the students and faculties of the college. Suggestions with regard to environment protection were collected from everyone who visited the exhibition. The best posters were felicitated with certificates and trophies and all the other participants were encouraged by presenting them with medicinal plant saplings to inculcate the importance of nurturing plants.</p>

			<p align=justify>Let's join hands to conserve and preserve the resources of our nature for our future generations. It is our duty to strive to protect the environment through small changes to our daily routine for a better world for us, our family, our community and all living things now and forever. Below are some of the little things which we can do towards achieving this goal.</p>

<p align=justify>1. Create a compost heap in your garden or use a compost bin. This helps recycle food waste and other biodegradable materials.<br>
2. When going shopping, make it a habit to bring your own eco-bags and say no to plastic bags as much as possible.<br>
3. Join as many tree planting trips as you can.<br>
4. If possible, try carpooling to work, business presentations, events or even to run errands. Think of ways you can reduce the number of trips you make using your car.<br>
5. Reduce emissions from cars by walking or cycling. These are not just great alternatives to driving, they are also great exercise.<br>
6. Use public transport, when you can, for everyday travel.<br>
7. Send your drinking bottles, paper, used oil, old batteries and used tires to a depot for recycling or safe disposal; all these very cause serious pollution.<br>
8. Do not pour chemicals and waste oil on to the ground or into drains leading to bodies of water.<br>
9. Wherever possible, separate biodegradable and recyclable waste from non-biodegradable and work to reduce the amount of non-biodegradable or recyclable waste.<br>
	10. Reduce the amount of meat you eat, or even better become vegetarian.</p>

			<p>Together, let us nurture the nature for a better future.</p>
