Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become the backbone of a global society and use of ICT in teaching-learning is one of the benchmarks of institutional excellence.

The use of technology in classroom ensures a positive learning experience. Use of online resources, learning platforms and evaluation mechanisms has facilitated an effective transference of knowledge. Enrolment in online courses has been on a sharp rise since. The gap in Higher Education of India in terms of Access, Equity and Quality can be bridged through effective use of technology.</p>
