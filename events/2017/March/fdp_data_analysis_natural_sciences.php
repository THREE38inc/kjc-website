Dr.Sonia Angeline, FDP Convener, proposed the Vote of thanks. The resource persons briefed about identifying research topics, variables, and methodological approaches followed by data collection, assessment strategies and interpretation methods. Ethics in research are very important when an experiment is going to be conducted. Ethics should be applied on all stages of research, such as planning, conducting and evaluating a research project. The first thing to do before designing a study is to consider the potential cost and benefits of the research. 25 faculty members from various colleges in and around Bangalore participated and gained a lot of information from this FDP especially the online training enabled them to understand various concepts. The delegates were happy with the FDP, they were happy with the topic and practical sessions. Most of the delegates suggested that more time should be allotted for practical sessions. The FDP served as a platform to provide comprehensive introduction to the statistical methods used in natural sciences to analyze empirical and experimental data. The FDP also served to bridge the gap between theory and practice. To help the budding researchers get an insight into ethics, data gathering and analysis, and statistics.</p>
