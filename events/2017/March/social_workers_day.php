			<p align=justify>The Department of Social Work organized a Program followed by an exhibition on account of World Social Workers Day on the 24th March 2017 in the college premises.</p>

			<p align=justify>The Chief Guest for the Program was Rev. Fr. Riju Jose Vazhaparambil (Executive Director of Pastoral Sociology Institute, Bangalore) who is one of the close associates of most programs conducted by the Department of Social Work. Fr. Riju inaugurated the exhibition after which the dignitaries, Faculty members and Students of the Department of Social Work proceeded to the Celebration of World Social Workers Day. The dignitaries seated on the dais for the celebration were Rev. Fr. Riju Jose Vazhaparambil (Executive Director of Pastoral Sociology Institute, Bangalore), Rev. Fr.

Riju Jose Vazhaparambil with the bouquet of flowers.</p>

			<p align=justify>Rev. Fr. Augustine George graced the occasion and exhorted the budding Social Work Students to find one's own identity through service to others. Fr. Riju Jose Vazhaparambil addressed the students on the importance and need of social workers in today's sophisticated society. Father began the session by highlighting the theme for International World Social Work Day 2017- 'To Promote Community & Sustainable Environment".</p>

			<p align=justify>Father stated that the profession of Social Work should manifest itself through the 'Power of Love' rather than the 'Love of Power'. He urged the students to have a passion to reach out to people, have an innovative approach in solving social issues & be abreast of all that is happening around to make a lasting impact in the society.</p>

			<p align=justify>Father Riju concluded the formal celebration by citing examples of Mother Teresa & Shri Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize Winners for their outstanding contributions towards their service to mankind & thus humbly pleaded the students to take encouragement from them.</p>
