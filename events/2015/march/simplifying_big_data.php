				The Management development programme on big data was held on the 28th of March 2015. The session started off with an invocation song by the department choir. We had 3 different talented personalities and resource person from the corporate field. Mr. Vineet Mittal, Ms. Mandira Shah and Mr. Srinath Gopalakrishnan. The entire MDP was divided into three different sessions, in which the various resource persons spoke and give us an insight about big data. Simplifying big data with Hadoop. Why big data is important? 90% of the world's data was generated in the last two years. You need a place to store, analyse and use it. If a person uses google, amazon, facebook then he or she is a user of big data. A definition of big data is the 4 Vs- volume, velocity, variability and variety. Big data techniques and technologies makes handling data at extreme scale economical. Eg. Log data from computing machine that helps in solving security breaches in the enterprise etc. All the three session were very interactive and interesting. The MDP ended with the college anthem.</p>
