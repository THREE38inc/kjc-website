			<p align=justify>The vinimay leadership series was held on the 19th April 2015 jointly for the MBA and MCA batch. The session started off with the invocation song by the department choir. The speaker for the day was Shri. AravindWarrier SR BP HR & University Relationship Novo Nordish India Ltd, Bangalore. He started the session by asking the students what the ROI of the session is, what they would take back at the end of the session. HR looks like a bad cop. Being a leader is the essence of this session. Creating leaders with impact. Everyday have your goals fixed. One can always make themselves strong and build self-confidence by looking into the mirror and practicing before one could do or perform something and this would also help you to overcome fear. Learn from others what your strengths are. Make a note on all the activities and update your resumes monthly or weekly. MBA is for re-engineering our attitude and character. Put all efforts towards goals and objective. Goals should be big, hairy and audacious. The session was interesting and interactive.</p>
