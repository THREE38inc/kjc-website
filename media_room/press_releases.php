The inauguration fest is a part of College’s higher intentions wherein the new students are introduced to the campus culture, values and best practices.</p>
                                                        <p align=justify>During ‘Shubh Aarambh’, Fr. Josekutty P.D, Principal, elaborated on the importance of education on the overall development of an individual. He mentioned that education can only be fruitful when one realizes the real attitudes and values in life coupled with continuous strive for excellence. Kristu Jayanti College aims at the continuous and comprehensive training in knowledge and skills along with morale training, thus motivating the students to achieve their life goals. “The college purposes to empower every student, to make them realize their potential, so that in the future they can empower others in their life,” he added.</p>

They stand for Resourcefulness, Responsibility and Respectability. When a student is resourceful, he is keeping up to the expectations of his parents and teachers. Being resourceful alone cannot make a person complete, one needs to have the courage to take up responsibilities, at the same time giving and taking respect. “When these three elements are blended together, you will be molding yourself for the future challenges in life,” reminded the Principal.</p>
                                                        <p align=justify>The principal introduced the students to the theme of academic year 2017-18, ‘wellness through academic excellence’; emphasizing that real wellness is the combination of physical, spiritual and emotional wellbeing. The college’s anti ragging committee was also familiarized to the students in the attempt of making the campus hundred percent ragging free.</p>

Fr. Augustine George, Vice Principal, gave the introductory prayer, while the Deaneries from various departments quoted verses from Quran, Bible and Rig Veda.</p>
                                                        <p align=justify>The Post Graduate students are also provides life skills training aiming at their overall personality development.

The first, she said, was to be oneself, and to do what one wants one to do. The second was to start doing what one wants to do in small things. And the final point from her was that women don’t need empowerment, but need to start respecting each other.</p>

                                                        <p align=justify>The workshop on self-defense for the Post Graduate women students was conducted by a team from the School of Martial Arts, led by Master Poondhanam, Senior Black Belt, and Master Balraj, Senior Black Belt, Senior Black Belt.
